# Allow .pro files to specify include path(s) to be prepended to the list.
#
# This allows the project to override the default ordering, whereby paths
# relative to $$QMAKE_INCDIR_QT always come first.  This ordering can cause
# problems when both the epoc32/include tree and a Qt include directory
# contain a header of the same name - in this case, the Qt header is always
# included by virtue of its path appearing first in the SYSTEMINCLUDE
# directives in the generated MMP file.
#
# To work around this situation, the following line can be added to the .pro
# file:
#	PREPEND_INCLUDEPATH = /epoc32/include
#
INCLUDEPATH = $$PREPEND_INCLUDEPATH $$INCLUDEPATH
