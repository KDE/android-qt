    \since 4.7

    \preliminary
    \brief The QMediaControl class provides a base interface for media service controls.

    Media controls provide an interface to individual features provided by a media service.  Most
    services implement a principal control which exposes the core functionality of the service and
    a number optional controls which expose any additional functionality.

    A pointer to a control implemented by a media service can be obtained using the
    \l {QMediaService::control()}{control()} member of QMediaService.  If the service doesn't
    implement a control it will instead return a null pointer.

    \code
    QMediaPlayerControl *control = qobject_cast<QMediaPlayerControl *>(
            service->control("com.nokia.Qt.QMediaPlayerControl/1.0"));
    \endcode

    Alternatively if the IId of the control has been declared using Q_MEDIA_DECLARE_CONTROL
    the template version of QMediaService::control() can be used to request the service without
    explicitly passing the IId.

    \code
    QMediaPlayerControl *control = service->control<QMediaPlayerControl *>();
    \endcode

    Most application code will not interface directly with a media service's controls, instead the
    QMediaObject which owns the service acts as an intermeditary between one or more controls and
    the application.

/*!
    \macro Q_MEDIA_DECLARE_CONTROL(Class, IId)
    \relates QMediaControl

    The Q_MEDIA_DECLARE_CONTROL macro declares an \a IId for a \a Class that inherits from
    QMediaControl.

    Declaring an IId for a QMediaControl allows an instance of that control to be requested from
    QMediaService::control() without explicitly passing the IId.

    \code
    QMediaPlayerControl *control = service->control<QMediaPlayerControl *>();
    \endcode

    \sa QMediaService::control()
