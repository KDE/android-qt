  \class QAbstractUriResolver
  \brief The QAbstractUriResolver class is a callback interface for resolving Uniform Resource Identifiers.
  \since 4.4
  \reentrant
  \ingroup xml-tools

  A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string that uniquely
  identifies a resource. URIs are versatile global identifiers. It is
  often useful to transform a URI that identifies something logical
  into a URI that locates something physical (a URL), or to simply map
  a URI to a different URI. QAbstractUriResolver::resolve() provides
  this functionality.

  For example, one could write a QAbstractUriResolver subclass that
  rewrites library ISBN number URIs as book title URLs, e.g.,
  \e{urn:isbn:0-345-33973-8} would be rewritten as
  \e{file:///books/returnOfTheKing.doc}. Or a QAbstractUriResolver
  subclass could be written for a web browser to let the web browser
  protect the user's private files by mapping incoming requests for
  them to null URIs.

  \fn QUrl QAbstractUriResolver::resolve(const QUrl &relative, const QUrl &baseURI) const

  Returns the \a relative URI resolved using the \a baseURI.

  The caller guarantees that both \a relative and \a baseURI are
  valid, and that \a baseURI is absolute. \a relative can be relative,
  absolute, or empty.

  The returned QUrl can be a default constructed QUrl. If it is not a
  default constructed QUrl, it will be absolute and valid. If a default
  constructed QUrl is returned, it means the \a relative URI was not
  accepted to be resolved.

  If the reimplemented resolve() function decides it has nothing to do
  about resolving the \a relative URI, it should simply return the \a
  relative URI resolved against the \a baseURI, i.e.:
