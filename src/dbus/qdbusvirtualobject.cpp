    \fn bool QDBusVirtualObject::handleMessage(const QDBusMessage &message, const QDBusConnection &connection) = 0

    This function needs to handle all messages to the path of the
    virtual object, when the SubPath option is specified.
    The service, path, interface and methos are all part of the message.
    Must return true when the message is handled, otherwise false (will generate dbus error message).

/*!
    \internal
    \fn QString QDBusVirtualObject::introspect(const QString &path) const

    This function needs to handle the introspection of the
    virtual object. It must return xml of the form:

    \code
<interface name="com.trolltech.QtDBus.MyObject" >
    <property access="readwrite" type="i" name="prop1" />
</interface>
    \endcode

    If you pass the SubPath option, this introspection has to include all child nodes.
    Otherwise QDBus handles the introspection of the child nodes.
