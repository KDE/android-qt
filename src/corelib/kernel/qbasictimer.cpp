    \class QBasicTimer
    \brief The QBasicTimer class provides timer events for objects.

    \ingroup events

    This is a fast, lightweight, and low-level class used by Qt
    internally. We recommend using the higher-level QTimer class
    rather than this class if you want to use timers in your
    applications.

    To use this class, create a QBasicTimer, and call its start()
    function with a timeout interval and with a pointer to a QObject
    subclass. When the timer times out it will send a timer event to
    the QObject subclass. The timer can be stopped at any time using
    stop(). isActive() returns true for a timer that is running;
    i.e. it has been started, has not reached the timeout time, and
    has not been stopped. The timer's ID can be retrieved using
    timerId().

    The \l{widgets/wiggly}{Wiggly} example uses QBasicTimer to repaint
    a widget at regular intervals.
