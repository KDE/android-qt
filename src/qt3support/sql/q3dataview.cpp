    \class Q3DataView
    \brief The Q3DataView class provides read-only SQL forms.

    \compat

    This class provides a form which displays SQL field data from a
    record buffer. Because Q3DataView does not support editing it uses
    less resources than a Q3DataBrowser. This class is well suited for
    displaying read-only data from a SQL database.

    If you want a to present your data in an editable form use
    Q3DataBrowser; if you want a table-based presentation of your data
    use Q3DataTable.

    The form is associated with the data view with setForm() and the
    record is associated with setRecord(). You can also pass a
    QSqlRecord to the refresh() function which will set the record to
    the given record and read the record's fields into the form.

    name, and with widget flags \a fl.
