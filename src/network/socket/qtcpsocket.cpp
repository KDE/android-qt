    \class QTcpSocket

    \brief The QTcpSocket class provides a TCP socket.

    \reentrant
    \ingroup network
    \inmodule QtNetwork

    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable,
    stream-oriented, connection-oriented transport protocol. It is
    especially well suited for continuous transmission of data.

    QTcpSocket is a convenience subclass of QAbstractSocket that
    allows you to establish a TCP connection and transfer streams of
    data. See the QAbstractSocket documentation for details.

    \bold{Note:} TCP sockets cannot be opened in QIODevice::Unbuffered mode.

    \section1 Symbian Platform Security Requirements

    On Symbian, processes which use this class must have the
    \c NetworkServices platform security capability. If the client
    process lacks this capability, it will result in a panic.

    Platform security capabilities are added via the
    \l{qmake-variable-reference.html#target-capability}{TARGET.CAPABILITY}
    qmake variable.
