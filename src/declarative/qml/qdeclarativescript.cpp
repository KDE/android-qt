    \qmlclass Script QDeclarativeScript
    \since 4.7
    \brief The Script element provides a way to add JavaScript code snippets in QML.
    \ingroup group_utility

    The Script element is used to add convenient JavaScript "glue" methods to
    your Qt Declarative application or component. 

    An example: 

    \qml
    Script {
        function debugMyComponent() {
            console.log(text.text);
            console.log(otherinterestingitem.property);
        }
    }
    MouseArea { onClicked: debugMyComponent() }
    \endqml

    \note While it is possible to use any JavaScript code within a Script element,
    it is recommended that the code be limited to defining functions. The Script
    element executes JavaScript as soon as it is specified, so
    when defining a component, this may be done before the execution context is
    fully specified.  As a result, some properties or items may not be
    accessible. You can avoid this problem by limiting your JavaScript to
    defining functions that are only executed later once the context is fully
    defined.

/*!
    \qmlproperty string Script::script
    \default
    The JavaScript code to be executed.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty url Script::source

    Specifies a source file containing JavaScript code. This can be used instead
    of providing inline JavaScript code in the Script element.
