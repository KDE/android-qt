    \brief The QWSGLWindowSurface class provides the drawing area for top-level
    windows with Qt for Embedded Linux on EGL/OpenGL ES. It also provides the
    drawing area for \l{QGLWidget}s whether they are top-level windows or
    children of another QWidget.

    Note that this class is only available in Qt for Embedded Linux and only
    available if Qt is configured with OpenGL support.
