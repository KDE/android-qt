    \class QMacCocoaViewContainer
    \since 4.5

    \brief The QMacCocoaViewContainer class provides a widget for Mac OS X that can be used to wrap arbitrary
    Cocoa views (i.e., NSView subclasses) and insert them into Qt hierarchies.

    \ingroup advanced

    While Qt offers a lot of classes for writing your application, Apple's
    Cocoa framework offers lots of functionality that is not currently in Qt or
    may never end up in Qt. Using QMacCocoaViewContainer, it is possible to put an
    arbitrary NSView-derived class from Cocoa and put it in a Qt hierarchy.
    Depending on how comfortable you are with using objective-C, you can use
    QMacCocoaViewContainer directly, or subclass it to wrap further functionality
    of the underlying NSView.

    QMacCocoaViewContainer works regardless if Qt is built against Carbon or
    Cocoa. However, QCocoaContainerView requires Mac OS X 10.5 or better to be
    used with Carbon.

    It should be also noted that at the low level on Mac OS X, there is a
    difference between windows (top-levels) and view (widgets that are inside a
    window). For this reason, make sure that the NSView that you are wrapping
    doesn't end up as a top-level. The best way to ensure this is to make sure
    you always have a parent and not set the parent to 0.

    If you are using QMacCocoaViewContainer as a sub-class and are mixing and
    matching objective-C with C++ (a.k.a. objective-C++). It is probably
    simpler to have your file end with \tt{.mm} than \tt{.cpp}. Most Apple tools will
    correctly identify the source as objective-C++.

    QMacCocoaViewContainer requires knowledge of how Cocoa works, especially in
    regard to its reference counting (retain/release) nature. It is noted in
    the functions below if there is any change in the reference count. Cocoa
    views often generate temporary objects that are released by an autorelease
    pool. If this is done outside of a running event loop, it is up to the
    developer to provide the autorelease pool.

    The following is a snippet of subclassing QMacCocoaViewContainer to wrap a NSSearchField.
