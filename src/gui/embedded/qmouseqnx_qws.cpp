    \class QQnxMouseHandler
    \preliminary
    \ingroup qws
    \internal
    \since 4.6

    \brief The QQnxMouseHandler class implements a mouse driver
    for the QNX \c{devi-hid} input manager.

    To be able to compile this mouse handler, \l{Qt for Embedded Linux}
    must be configured with the \c -qt-mouse-qnx option, see the
    \l{Qt for Embedded Linux Pointer Handling}{Pointer Handling} documentation for details.

    In order to use this mouse handler, the \c{devi-hid} input manager
    must be set up and run with the resource manager interface (option \c{-r}).
    Also, Photon must not be running.

    Example invocation from command line: \c{/usr/photon/bin/devi-hid -Pr kbd mouse}
    Note that after running \c{devi-hid}, you will not be able to use the local
    shell anymore. It is suggested to run the command in a shell scrip, that launches
    a Qt application after invocation of \c{devi-hid}.

    To make \l{Qt for Embedded Linux} explicitly choose the qnx mouse
    handler, set the QWS_MOUSE_PROTO environment variable to \c{qnx}. By default,
    the first mouse device (\c{/dev/devi/mouse0}) is used. To override, pass a device
    name as the first and only parameter, for example
    \c{QWS_MOUSE_PROTO=qnx:/dev/devi/mouse1; export QWS_MOUSE_PROTO}.

/*!
    Constructs a mouse handler for the specified \a device, defaulting to \c{/dev/devi/mouse0}.
    The \a driver parameter must be \c{"qnx"}.

    Note that you should never instanciate this class, instead let QMouseDriverFactory
    handle the mouse handlers.
