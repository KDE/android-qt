    \class QAssistantClient
    \obsolete
    \brief The QAssistantClient class provides a means of using Qt
    Assistant as an application's help tool.

    \ingroup helpsystem

    \bold{Note:} \e{This class is obsolete and only required when using
    the old Qt Assistant, now called assistant_adp. If you want to use
    the new Qt Assistant as a remote help viewer, simple create a
    QProcess instance and specify \tt{assistant} as its executable.
    The following code shows how to start Qt Assistant and request a
    certain page to be shown:}

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/tools_assistant_compat_lib_qassistantclient.cpp 0
    
    \e{For a complete example using the Qt Assistant remotely, see the \l
    {help/remotecontrol}{Remote Control} example.}
    
    In order to make Qt Assistant act as a customized help tool for
    your application, you must provide your application with a
    QAssistantClient object in addition to a \l
    {assistant-manual.html} {Qt Assistant Document Profile} (\c .adp
    file) and the associated documentation.

    Note that the QAssistantClient class is not included in the Qt
    library. To use it you must add the following line to your pro
    file:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/tools_assistant_compat_lib_qassistantclient.cpp 1

    A QAssistantClient instance can open or close Qt Assistant
    whenever it is required.

    Once you have created a QAssistantClient instance, specifying the
    path to the Qt Assistant executable, using Qt Assistant is
    simple: You can either call the openAssistant() slot to show the
    defined start page of the documentation, or you can call the
    showPage() slot to show a particular help page. When you call
    openAssistant() and showPage(), Qt Assistant will be launched if
    it isn't already running. When Qt Assistant is running, the
    isOpen() function returns true.

    When calling showPage() the Qt Assistant instance will also be
    brought to the foreground if its hidden. The showPage() slot can
    be called multiple times, while calling openAssistant() several
    times without closing the application in between, will have no
    effect.

    You can close Qt Assistant at any time using the closeAssistant()
    slot. When you call openAssistant(), or you call showPage()
    without a previous call to openAssistant(), the assistantOpened()
    signal is emitted. Similarly when closeAssistant() is called,
    assistantClosed() is emitted. In either case, if an error occurs,
    error() is emitted.

    One QAssistantClient instance interacts with one Qt Assistant
    instance, so every time you call openAssistant(), showPage() or
    closeAssistant() they are applied to the particular Qt Assistant
    instance associated with the QAssistantClient.

    Qt Assistant's documentation set can be altered using the command
    line arguments that are passed to the application when it is
    launched. When started without any options, Qt Assistant displays
    a default set of documentation. When Qt is installed, the default
    documentation set in Qt Assistant contains the Qt reference
    documentation as well as the tools that come with Qt, such as \QD
    and \c qmake.

    Use the setArguments() function to specify the command line
    arguments. You can add or remove documentation from Qt Assistant
    by adding and removing the relevant content files: The command
    line arguments are \c {-addContentFile file.dcf} and \c
    {-removeContentFile file.dcf} respectively. You can make Qt
    Assistant run customized documentation sets that are separate from
    the Qt documentation, by specifying a profile: \c {-profile
    myapplication.adp}. The profile format can also be used to alter
    several of Qt Assistant's properties such as its title and
    startpage.

    The Documentation Content File (\c .dcf) and Qt Assistant
    Documentation Profile (\c .adp) formats are documented in the \l
    {assistant-manual.html}{Qt Assistant Manual}.

    For a complete example using the QAssistantClient class, see the
    \e{Simple Text Viewer} example. The example shows how you can make
    Qt Assistant act as a customized help tool for your application
    using the QAssistantClient class combined with a Qt Assistant
    Document Profile.
