 * Determine the epoc root for the currently active SDK.
 *
 * The algorithm used is as follows:
 * 1. If environment variable EPOCROOT is set and points to an existent
 *    directory, this is returned.
 * 2. The location of devices.xml is specified by a registry key.  If this
 *    file exists, it is parsed.
 * 3. If the EPOCDEVICE environment variable is set and a corresponding
 *    entry is found in devices.xml, and its epocroot value points to an
 *    existent directory, it is returned.
 * 4. If a device element marked as default is found in devices.xml and its
 *    epocroot value points to an existent directory, this is returned.
 * 5. An empty string is returned.
 *
 * Any return value other than the empty string therefore is guaranteed to
 * point to an existent directory.
