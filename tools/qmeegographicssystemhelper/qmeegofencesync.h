//! A synchronization helper for GL pipeline.
/*!
 Fence syncs provide a mechanism for synchronizing access to certain GL primitives
 and make it possible for the application developer to be sure that a certain point
 in the GL processing pipeline has been already executed before continuing operation.

 Currently fence syncs are only useful in conjunction with QMeeGoLivePixmaps.
 \code
 ...
 // In your paint/expose event:
 QImage *image = livePixmap->lock(&someGlobalFenceSync);
 // Modify the image...
 livePixmap->release(image);

 painter->drawPixmap(0, 0, *livePixmap);
 someGlobalFenceSync.setSyncPoint();
 ...
 \endcode

 Assuming the paint/expose events come repeatedly, the lock operation
 will block till the previous event completed painting the livePixmap.
