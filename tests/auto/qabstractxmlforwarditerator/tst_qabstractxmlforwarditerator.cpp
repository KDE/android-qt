 \brief Tests class QAbstractXmlForwardIterator.

 This test is not intended for testing the engine, but the functionality specific
 to the QAbstractXmlForwardIterator class.

 In other words, if you have an engine bug; don't add it here because it won't be
 tested properly. Instead add it to the test suite.
