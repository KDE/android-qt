/*! \class QSystemLocker

    \brief The QSystemLocker class is a convenience class that simplifies
    locking and unlocking system locks.

    The purpose of QSystemLocker is to simplify QSystemLock locking and
    unlocking.  Locking and unlocking a QSystemLock in complex functions and
    statements or in exception handling code is error-prone and difficult to
    debug.  QSystemLocker can be used in such situations to ensure that the
    state of the locks is always well-defined.

    QSystemLocker should be created within a function where a QSystemLock needs
    to be locked. The system lock is locked when QSystemLocker is created.  If
    locked, the system lock will be unlocked when the QSystemLocker is
    destroyed.  QSystemLocker can be unlocked with unlock() and relocked with
    relock().

    \sa QSystemLock
 */

/*! \fn QSystemLocker::QSystemLocker()

    Constructs a QSystemLocker and locks \a lock. The \a lock will be
    unlocked when the QSystemLocker is destroyed. If lock is zero,
    QSystemLocker does nothing.

    \sa QSystemLock::lock()
  */

/*! \fn QSystemLocker::~QSystemLocker()

    Destroys the QSystemLocker and unlocks it if it was
    locked in the constructor.

    \sa QSystemLock::unlock()
 */

/*! \fn QSystemLocker::systemLock()

    Returns a pointer to the lock that was locked in the constructor.
 */

/*! \fn QSystemLocker::relock()

    Relocks an unlocked locker.

    \sa unlock()
  */

/*! \fn QSystemLocker::unlock()

    Unlocks this locker. You can use relock() to lock it again.
    It does not need to be locked when destroyed.

    \sa relock()
 */

/*! \class QSystemLock

    \brief The QSystemLock class provides a system wide lock
    that can be used between threads or processes.

    The purpose of a QSystemLocker is to protect an object that can be
    accessed by multiple threads or processes such as shared memory or a file.

    For example, say there is a method which prints a message to a log file:

    void log(const QString &logText)
    {
        QSystemLock systemLock(QLatin1String("logfile"));
        systemLock.lock();
        QFile file(QDir::temp() + QLatin1String("/log"));
        if (file.open(QIODevice::Append)) {
            QTextStream out(&file);
            out << logText;
        }
        systemLock.unlock();
    }

    If this is called from two separate processes the resulting log file is
    guaranteed to contain both lines.

    When you call lock(), other threads or processes that try to call lock()
    with the same key will block until the thread or process that got the lock
    calls unlock().

    A non-blocking alternative to lock() is tryLock().

    unlocked state.

    setKey(key);

    other attempts to lock will block until the lock is unlocked.  A given
