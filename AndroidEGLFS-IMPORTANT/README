============== Intro ===============
The Android-EGLFS is an research project and a first setup towards and OpenGL-enabled Qt-Android-port

This research can display:
- QGLWidget fullscreen(!)
- nothing else


If you need some first hint for what you can use this:
- https://gitorious.org/qmlshowcase/qmlshowcase
        see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmuCecElBJs
- re-implement QGLWidget::paintGL() and do plain GL



============== Devices =============
Devices this is tested on and is running:
-  HTC Nexus One  - Android 2.3.4
(I'll update this list as soon as I get some feedback)

Devices this is tested on but is NOT running:
- Emulator - doesn't have OpenGL ES2 support
- Samsung Galaxy Tab 7" Android 2.2
        Appears to not be able to eglBindTexImage
        Please help me if you know why



============== HOW-TO ==============
What do you need to do:
1. build this branch

2. build or download/install
    git@git.kde.org:/android-qt-creator.git
    (aka. Necessitas Qt Suite)

3. add you Qt build

4. add some project (e.g. qmlshowcase)
   remove any use of OpenGL!!
        .. start by removing opengl from your project-file
   Just comment it because you need it later!

5. deploy projects including(!) local Qt libs:
    Projects -> Run -> Deploy Configuration -> "Deploy local qt libs"
    ... don't forget to set the your(!) qt libs for your project:
    Projects -> Build -> General -> Qt version 

6. Now the application should run in raster-mode because
     a, you haven't replaced the java files yet
and  b, you're linking to libandroid-8.so  (raster version)


----------- STOP -----------
If this is working so far you can proceed, if not you need to fix your problems first!!
To double check that it's working you can empty your Ministor-cache and re-deploy your local qt libs
... if Ministor pops up after you've deployed you local libs, something is wrong! :)
(Settings -> Applications -> Manage Applications -> Ministor -> empty cache)
---------------------------

7. re-add/uncomment the previously removed OpenGL-code

8. Use the *.java files in this directory to replace the ones of your projects
(They got automatically added by the Necessitas Qt Suite)

9. push libandroid-9.so as libandroid-8.so (or link against libandroid-9.so if you know how)
    e.g.: ~/projects/andriod/android-sdk-linux_x86/platform-tools/adb push libandroid-9.so   /data/local/qt/plugins/platforms/android/libandroid-8.so

10a. If you see the right stuff on the screen, let me know by sending my a email: thomas.senyk@nokia.com
     Please include a short device description (HW and android version), so that I can get a better understanding where this is running.

10b. If you got error/empty screen: email to thomas.senyk@nokia.com :)
     please provide as much informations as possible:
        - full log
        - full description of what you've done/build/installed
        - full description what's actually working
        - full description of you device (hardware, android version)
