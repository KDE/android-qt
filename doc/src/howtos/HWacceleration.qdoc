    \title Hardware Acceleration &amp Embedded Platforms.
    \brief How to use hardware acceleration for fast rendering.

    \ingroup best-practices

    \section1 Abstract

    This document describes how to use hardware acceleration for fast
    rendering on embedded platforms supported by Qt. In short, it
    explains how the graphics pipeline works. Since there might be
    differences to how the APIs are being used on different embedded
    platforms, a table links to documentation dedicated to platform
    specific documentation for each supported hardware acceleration
    API.

    \section1 Supported platforms
	Since there might be differences to how the APIs are being used on
	the different embedded platforms, this table provides you with links to
	pages dedicated to platform specific documentation for each
	supported hardware acceleration API. Click the API link for the
	platform to go the correct documentation.
