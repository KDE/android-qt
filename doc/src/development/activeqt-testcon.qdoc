    \title testcon - An ActiveX Test Container (ActiveQt)

    \ingroup activeqt-tools

    \keyword testcon

    This application implements a generic test container for ActiveX
    controls. You can insert ActiveX controls installed on your
    system, and execute methods and modify properties. The container
    will log information about events and property changes as well
    as debug output in the log window.

    Parts of the code use internals of the Qt meta object and ActiveQt 
    framework and are not recommended to be used in application code.

    Use the application to view the slots, signals and porperties 
    available through the QAxWidget class when instantiated with a 
    certain ActiveX, and to test ActiveX controls you implement or
    want to use in your Qt application.

    The application can load and execute script files in JavaScript, 
    VBScript, Perl and Python (if installed) to automate the controls 
    loaded. Example script files using the QAxWidget2 class are available 
    in the \c scripts subdirectory.

    Note that the qmake project of this example includes a resource file
    \c testcon.rc with a version resource. This is required by some
    ActiveX controls (ie. Shockwave ActiveX Controls), which might crash
    or misbehave otherwise if such version information is missing.

    To build the tool you must first build the QAxContainer and the
    QAxServer libraries. Then run your make  tool in \c tools/testcon
    and run the resulting \c testcon.exe.
