    \namespace Phonon
    \brief The Phonon namespace contains classes and functions for multimedia applications.
    \since 4.4

    This namespace contains classes to access multimedia functions for
    audio and video playback. Those classes are not dependent on any specific
    framework, but rather use exchangeable backends to do the work.

    See the \l{Phonon Module} page for general information about the
    framework and the \l{Phonon Overview} for an introductory tour of its
    features.
