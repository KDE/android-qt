    Dialogs can be \e{modal}, in which case the user is required to provide
    necessary information before work in the main window
    can continue, or \e{modeless}. Modeless dialogs do not prevent the user from
    interacting with any of the other windows in the application.

    Qt provides a set of ready-made dialogs for file, font, color-selection
    and more.

    \annotatedlist standard-dialogs

    Custom dialogs can be easily created by composing regular widgets into
    a QDialog. These classes are specifically designed for building custom
    dialogs:
