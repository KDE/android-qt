    \brief Information about the license and features of the Commercial Edition.

    Qt can be used to develop closed source software if you obtain a commercial

    Open Source license, you can use the \l{Open Source Versions of Qt}.

    The following table is a summary of the licenses under which Qt is made available.

    \table
    \row \o \bold{Qt Commercial Developer License}
    \o The Qt Commercial Developer License is the appropriate version to use for the
    development of proprietary and/or commercial software where the developer does not
    wish to share or distribute any source code of the Qt libraries or otherwise comply
    with the terms of the \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)}{GNU Lesser General
    Public License version 2.1} or \l{GNU General Public License (GPL)}{GNU GPL version
    3.0}.
    \row \o \bold{Qt GNU LGPL v. 2.1}

    \row \o \bold{Qt GNU GPL v. 3.0}
    \o This version of Qt is appropriate for the development of Qt applications where
    you wish to use such applications in combination with software subject to the terms
    of the GNU General Public License version 3.0 or where you are otherwise willing to
    comply with the terms of the
    \l{GNU General Public License (GPL)}{GNU General Public License version 3.0}.
