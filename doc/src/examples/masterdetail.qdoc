    \title Master Detail Example

    The Master Detail Example shows how to present data from different
    data sources in the same application. The album titles, and the
    corresponding artists and release dates, are kept in a
    database, while each album's tracks are stored in an XML
    file.

    The example also shows how to add as well as remove data from both
    the database and the associated XML file using the API provided by
    the QtSql and QtXml modules, respectively.
